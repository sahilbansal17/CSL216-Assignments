## ARM Assembly Program Simulator with Multicycle operations and Pipelining 

- The instruction set simulator developed in the earlier assignments is enhanced, to also incorporate pipelining. It is attempted to be as aggressive as possible to avoid data and control hazards. 

- Statistics about the clock cycle counts and average *IPC* for the input program are printed at the end. 

- The simulator is capable of displaying, after each instruction, the various instructions that are currently residing in the pipeline, along with the stage that they are in. 

- Optionally, aggressive branch prediction features and instruction/data cache memory is planned to be implemented.
