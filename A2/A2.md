# Problem Statement :
Implement the [Linear-feedback shift register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register)  (LFSR) logic (as described by the C code) in ARM assembly language. Although the C program takes hard coded inputs, in the ARM assembly you have to take inputs (for the **start_state** variable) from a file and write outputs to a file.

**Input File Name**: in.txt

**Output File Name**: out.txt

Simulate your program on the ARMSim simulator and demonstrate its working.

**C Code**:
```c
#include <stdint.h>
int main(void){
    uint16_t start_state = 0xACE1u;  /* Any nonzero start state will work. */

    uint16_t lfsr = start_state;

    uint16_t bit;                    /* Must be 16bit to allow bit<<15 later in the code */

    unsigned period = 0;

    do{
        /* taps: 16 14 13 11; feedback polynomial: x^16 + x^14 + x^13 + x^11 + 1 */

        bit  = ((lfsr >> 0) ^ (lfsr >> 2) ^ (lfsr >> 3) ^ (lfsr >> 5) ) & 1;

        lfsr =  (lfsr >> 1) | (bit << 15);

        if (period < 5) printf("lfsr=%x\n", lfsr);

        ++period;
    }while (lfsr != start_state);

    printf("Post termination lfsr=%x", lfsr);

    return 0;
}

```
Prints are added to the above program only to validate the outputs.

**Tips for taking file input**:

See Section 8.1.1 in **ARMSim-Manual.pdf** uploaded (Detailed Descriptions and Examples for SWI Codes for I/O) to check how to Open/Close/Read/Write a File in ARMSim.


**Sample Input/Golden Output File**:

For in.txt/out.txt, assume input/output is stored in the hexadecimal format (all small letters). Sample input file and golden output file are uploaded.
